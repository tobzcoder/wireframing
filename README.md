# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide or blueprint that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product — such as a website, web app, or mobile app. It helps designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize the layout, structure, and flow of content before design and development begin.

Wireframes focus on **functionality and layout**, not aesthetics. They act as a bridge between design ideas and technical execution, ensuring every stakeholder understands how the product will function at a structural level.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

A good wireframe includes several essential components that define the user experience and layout:

- **Layout Structure:**  
  Defines how the page is organized (header, navigation, content, footer).  
  *Example:* A homepage layout might feature a top navigation bar, a hero section, and a grid of featured products or articles.

- **Navigation:**  
  Represents how users move through the product using links, buttons, or menus.  
  *Example:* A sidebar or top nav bar to help users switch between pages.

- **Content Placement:**  
  Shows where text, images, or call-to-action buttons will appear.  
  *Example:* Positioning “Sign Up” buttons near descriptive text to encourage conversions.

- **Functionality:**  
  Demonstrates how elements interact with users.  
  *Example:* Dropdowns, search bars, or modals to handle user input and feedback.
