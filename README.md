# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide or blueprint that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product â€” such as a website, web app, or mobile app. It helps designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize the layout, structure, and flow of content before design and development begin.

Wireframes focus on **functionality and layout**, not aesthetics. They act as a bridge between design ideas and technical execution, ensuring every stakeholder understands how the product will function at a structural level.
